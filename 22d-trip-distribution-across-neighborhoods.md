# Total and marginal distribution trips between neighborhoods

Let's focus our attention now the following important questions:
- Between which neighborhoods do the most common trips occur?  
- Assuming that a traveler leaves from a given neighborhood, which neighborhoods are they most likely to go to?
- Assuming that someone was just dropped off at a given neighborhood, which neighborhoods are they most likely to have come from?

To answer the above questions, we need to find the distribution (or proportion) of trips between any two neighborhoods, first as a percentage of total trips, then as a percentage of trips *leaving from* a particular neighborhood, and finally as a percentage of trips *going to* a particular neighborhood.

```R
rxc <- rxCube( ~ pickup_nb:dropoff_nb, mht_xdf)
rxc <- as.data.frame(rxc)

library(dplyr)
rxc %>% 
  filter(Counts > 0) %>%
  mutate(pct_all = Counts/sum(Counts) * 100) %>%
  group_by(pickup_nb) %>%
  mutate(pct_by_pickup_nb = Counts/sum(Counts) * 100) %>%
  group_by(dropoff_nb) %>%
  mutate(pct_by_dropoff_nb = Counts/sum(Counts) * 100) %>%
  group_by() %>%
  arrange(desc(Counts)) -> rxcs

head(rxcs)
```

```Rout

6 Garment District         Midtown 1072732 1.865847         28.94205

5          16.26146
6          10.84888
```

Based on the first row, we can see that trips from the Upper East Side to the Upper East Side make up about 5% of all trips in Manhattan.  Of all the trips that pick up in the Upper East Side, about 36% drop off in the Upper East Side.  Of all the trips that drop off in the Upper East Side, 37% and tripped that also picked up in the Upper East Side.
