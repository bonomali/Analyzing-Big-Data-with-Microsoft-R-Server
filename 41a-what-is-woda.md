# What is WODA?

In addition to offering scalable algorithms that run on large datasets, Microsoft R Server offers the ability to deploy those algorithms on multiple platforms with minimal changes to the code structure.  This is referred to as WODA, which stands for **write once and deploy anywhere**. WODA is an abstraction layer. It allows the data scientist to develop code locally (on a single machine and using smaller datasets) but deploy it in environments such as Hadoop, Spark or SQL Server *without having to change the code too much and without having to know too much about what goes on under the hood in such environments when the code is deployed*.
